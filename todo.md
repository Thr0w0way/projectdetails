Todo list for rpg game
=================

Tools:
--------
* gcc/mingw = compiler
* sfml = multimedia library
* codeblocks/visual studio = ide
* tiled = map editor

Todo:
--------
(in no particular order)
- main game loop (there's this: https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&p=37556#p37442 and this: https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run to draw inspiration from)
- reading map data (the Tiled map format is just XML either gzipped or zlibbed and then Base64'd) & drawing out maps
  - I suggest rapidxml for parsing XML (it's small and just werks)
- a story would be nice
