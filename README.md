##graphics/multimedia library --> sfml

##language --> c/c++

For linux I can just use gcc and on windows mingw should work fine.
I've only dabbled in the use of sfml before but I've heard that its
good from various sources. When I used it before I was able to set
it up simply with codeblocks, which is available for both windows 
and linux.
